Fork on GitHub - Convenient for custom development, but difficult to update, only suitable for web developers.Installing the Theme GemAdd this line to your Jekyll site’s Gemfile:gem \"jekyll-theme-chirpy\"And add this line to your Jekyll site’s _config.yml:theme: jekyll-theme-chirpyAnd then execute:$ bundleFinally, copy the required files from the theme’s gem (for detailed files, see starter project) to your Jekyll site. Hint: To locate the installed theme’s gem, execute: $ bundle info --path jekyll-theme-chirpy Or you can use the starter template to create a Jekyll site to save time copying files from the theme’s gem. We have prepared everything for you there!Fork on GitHubFork Chirpy on GitHub and then clone your fork to local. (Please note that the default branch code is in development. If you want the blog to be stable, please switch to the latest tag and start writing.)Install gem dependencies by:$ bundleAnd then execute:$ bash tools/init.sh Note: If you don’t plan to deploy your site on GitHub Pages, append parameter option --no-gh at the end of the above command.What it does is: Remove some files or directories from your repository: .travis.yml files under _posts folder docs If you use the --no-gh option, the directory .github will be deleted. Otherwise, setup the GitHub Action workflow by removing the extension .hook of .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml.hook, and then remove the other files and directories in the folder .github. Automatically create a commit to save the changes.UsageConfigurationUpdate the variables of _config.yml as needed. Some of them are typical options: url avatar timezone langRunning Local ServerYou may want to preview the site contents before publishing, so just run it by:$ bundle exec jekyll sOr run the site on Docker with the following command:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\ -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll serveOpen a browser and visit to http://localhost:4000.DeploymentBefore the deployment begins, checkout the file _config.yml and make sure the url is configured correctly. Furthermore, if you prefer the project site and don’t use a custom domain, or you want to visit your website with a base URL on a web server other than GitHub Pages, remember to change the baseurl to your project name that starting with a slash, e.g, /project-name.Now you can choose ONE of the following methods to deploy your Jekyll site.Deploy on GitHub PagesFor security reasons, GitHub Pages build runs on safe mode, which restricts us from using plugins to generate additional page files. Therefore, we can use GitHub Actions to build the site, store the built site files on a new branch, and use that branch as the source of the GH Pages service.Quickly check the files needed for GitHub Actions build: Ensure your Jekyll site has the file .github/workflows/pages-deploy.yml. Otherwise, create a new one and fill in the contents of the workflow file, and the value of the on.push.branches should be the same as your repo’s default branch name. Ensure your Jekyll site has file tools/test.sh and tools/deploy.sh. Otherwise, copy them from this repo to your Jekyll site.And then rename your repository to &lt;GH-USERNAME&gt;.github.io on GitHub.Now publish your Jekyll site by: Push any commit to remote to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow. Once the build is complete and successful, a new remote branch named gh-pages will appear to store the built site files. Browse to your repo’s landing page on GitHub and select the branch gh-pages as the publishing source through Settings → Options → GitHub Pages: Visit your website at the address indicated by GitHub. Deploy on Other PlatformsOn platforms other than GitHub, we cannot enjoy the convenience of GitHub Actions. Therefore, we should build the site locally (or on some other 3rd-party CI platform) and then put the site files on the server.Go to the root of the source project, build your site by:$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll bOr build the site with Docker by:$ docker run -it --rm \\ --env JEKYLL_ENV=production \\ --volume=\"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" \\ jekyll/jekyll \\ jekyll buildUnless you specified the output path, the generated site files will be placed in folder _site of the project’s root directory. Now you should upload those files to your web server." }, { "title": "Writing a New Post", "url": "/tmtdao/posts/write-a-new-post/", "categories": "Blogging, Tutorial", "tags": "writing", "date": "2019-08-08 06:10:00 +0000", "snippet": "Naming and PathCreate a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.EXTENSION and put it in the _posts/ of the root directory. Please note that the EXTENSION must be one of md and markdown.Front MatterBasically, you need to fill the Front Matter as below at the top of the post:---title: TITLEdate: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [TOP_CATEGORIE, SUB_CATEGORIE]tags: [TAG] # TAG names should always be lowercase--- Note: The posts’ layout has been set to post by default, so there is no need to add the variable layout in Front Matter block.Timezone of dateIn order to accurately record the release date of a post, you should not only setup the timezone of _config.yml but also provide the the post’s timezone in field date of its Front Matter block. Format: +/-TTTT, e.g. +0800.Categories and TagsThe categories of each post is designed to contain up to two elements, and the number of elements in tags can be zero to infinity. For instance:categories: [Animal, Insect]tags: [bee]Table of ContentsBy default, the Table of Contents (TOC) is displayed on the right panel of the post. If you want to turn it off globally, go to _config.yml and set the value of variable toc to false. If you want to turn off TOC for specific post, add the following to post’s Front Matter:---toc: false---CommentsSimilar to TOC, the Disqus comments is loaded by default in each post, and the global switch is defined by variable comments in file _config.yml . If you want to close the comment for specific post, add the following to the Front Matter of the post:---comments: false---MathematicsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---math: true---MermaidMermaid is a great diagrams generation tool. To enable it on your post, add the following to the YAML block:---mermaid: true---Then you can use it like other markdown language: surround the graph code with ```mermaid and ```.ImagesPreview imageIf you want to add an image to the top of the post contents, specify the attribute src, width, height and alt for the image:---image: src: /path/to/image/file width: 1000 # in pixels height: 400 # in pixels alt: image alternative text---Except for alt, all other options are necessary, especially the width and height, which are related to user experience and web page loading performance. Later section “Image size” will also mention this.Image captionAdd italics to the next line of an image，then it will become the caption and appear at the bottom of the image:![img-description](/path/to/image)_Image Caption_Image sizeIn order to prevent the page content layout from shifting when the image is loaded, we should set the width and height for each image:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: width=\"700\" height=\"400\" }Image positionBy default, the image is centered, but you can specify the position by using one of class normal , left and right. For example: Normal position Image will be left aligned in below sample: ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .normal } Float to the left ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .left } Float to the right ![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .right } Limitation: Once you specify the position of an image, it is forbidden to add the image caption.Image shadowThe screenshots of the program window can be considered to show the shadow effect, and the shadow will be visible in the light mode:![Desktop View](/assets/img/sample/mockup.png){: .shadow }CDN URLIf you host the images on the CDN, you can save the time of repeatedly writing the CDN url by assigning the variable img_cdn of _config.yml file:img_cdn: https://cdn.comOnce img_cdn is assigned, the CDN url will be added to the path of all images (images of site avatar and posts) starting with /.For instance, when using images:![The flower](/path/to/flower.png)The parsing result will automatically add the CDN prefix https://cdn.com before the image path:&lt;img src=\"https://cdn.com/path/to/flower.png\" alt=\"The flower\"&gt;Pinned PostsYou can pin one or more posts to the top of the home page, and the fixed posts are sorted in reverse order according to their release date.
